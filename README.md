Microsoft Graph is a great platform for connecting you to Office 365 account and empower your business with your rich development features. Microsoft Graph has a great API set to do unique operations within a secure way. In this repo. I just tried to demostrate how to listen your e-mail box for messages. According to your business you may want to do some integration jobs or some other things.

Mostly enterprises have some scheduled jobs that are listening some inboxes and do some fancy stuff. For example; 

* Generating customer requirments from an e-mail content
* Open a service ticket
* Reply with auto-reply templates according to a content
* Parse message content to get some specific texts
* ...
* ..

And many more... Nowadays most business are moving into Office365, so these kind of automations should be merged as Office365. In this repo., I just demostrated to read e-mail with Microsoft Graph API.
